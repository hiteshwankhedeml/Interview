# Explain the concept of Large Language Models (LLMs)

* Neural network models trained to understand and generate human language.
* Built mainly using the transformer architecture.
* Trained on massive text corpora to predict the next token given previous tokens.
* Learns grammar, semantics, facts, and patterns implicitly from data.
* Large number of parameters (millions to trillions).
* Trained on very large and diverse datasets.
